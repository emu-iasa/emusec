                    <p>Hello everyone,
                    <p>On behalf of the Information Assurance Student Association, we welcome you all back from the summer! We're really hoping to make this year a good one, and we'd love for you to join us in it!
                    <p>We're the IASA, a student led organization focused around Cyber Security. We work on projects, lab, and technology you won't get in the classroom. We then take what we know and travel to participate in several competitions both locally and around the U.S. If you're interested in bettering your knowledge in all things Cyber Security, join us this Friday at 5:30 in Roosevelt Room 6 for pizza and more information. We'll be talking about who we are as an organization, what we do during meetings, and the competitions we go to.
                    <p>Note: You don't have to be an expert in cyber security to participate! Our members range from very experienced people working the field to people who just entered the program. Nobody knows everything, especially in this field, and we're here to help you get there. 
                    <p>If you would like more information, feel free to email me at cmeyer25@emich.edu or put questions in our Slack channel at emusec.slack.com. To install Slack, either grab the Slack app on the Google Play Store or App Store, or go to https://slack.com/downloads/

                    <p>Hello Everyone,
                    <p>This week at IASA we'll be getting started with Google Cloud and an introduction to Linux Hardening. We'll be setting up VMs in Google Cloud, and starting to add users, harden services, and a few other initial tasks we do after getting on a VM either at a competition or on any new device that hasn't been secured yet.
                    <p>We'll then try and break into other club member's Google Cloud boxes next week.
                    <p>If you haven't already, log into Google Cloud with your emich.edu account to receive $300 in Cloud Computing credit! This will also save some time on Friday as we can just add you to the project and jump into hardening VMs. As always, feel free to email me with questions or message us in Slack with questions! The meeting will occur at 5:30 in Roosevelt room 6.
